# NorthSeaCoastalSailing

Hi, I am Manfred Grauvogl
I am 56 years old and live in the northern part of Germany
I studied physics and I develop tribological coatings.
As a hobby I started to learn HTML, CSS and javascript
Perhaps in the future I will develop web sites professionally.
So I am interessted in any kind of collaboration in that field.
